Configure DNS Records:

Depending on whether you're setting up an apex domain (e.g., yourdomain.com) or a subdomain (e.g., www.yourdomain.com), you'll need to adjust your DNS records accordingly:

For Apex Domains:

Create or update the following A records to point to GitHub Pages' IP addresses:

185.199.108.153

185.199.109.153

185.199.110.153

185.199.111.153

Ensure that any existing A records for your apex domain are removed or updated to prevent conflicts.

For Subdomains:

Create a CNAME record for your subdomain pointing to your GitHub Pages URL. For example, to set up www.yourdomain.com, create a CNAME record with:

Name: www

Value: yourusername.github.io

This directs traffic from www.yourdomain.com to your GitHub Pages site.

Configure Your GitHub Repository:

In your repository on GitHub, navigate to 'Settings'.​

Under the 'Pages' section, enter your custom domain (e.g., www.yourdomain.com) in the 'Custom domain' field and save the changes.​

This action creates a CNAME file in your repository, linking your custom domain to your GitHub Pages site.​

Verify and Test:

DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate. After this period, visit your custom domain in a web browser to ensure it's correctly directing to your GitHub Pages site.​

For HTTPS support, GitHub Pages automatically provides SSL certificates. After your custom domain is configured, GitHub will attempt to issue a certificate. This process may take some time.​

By following these steps, your Shinjiru-hosted domain will be successfully linked to your GitHub Pages site.​
